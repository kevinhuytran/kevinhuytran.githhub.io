                <h2>CLEAR THE PATH</h2>
                <p>Your team needs to clear at least one lane to get to the enemy Nexus. <br>
                    Blocking your path are defense structures called turrets and inhibitors. <br>
                    Each lane has three turrets and one inhibitor, and each Nexus is guarded by two turrets.</p>
